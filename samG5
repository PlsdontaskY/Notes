Code Injection Attack: This involves inserting malicious code into a web page or application, which then gets executed in another user’s browser.

Script Injection: An attacker inserts harmful scripts into web pages that other users will view, causing unwanted actions or data theft.

Web Script Vulnerability: A flaw in a website that allows attackers to run unauthorized scripts on users' browsers.

Malicious Code Execution: Unauthorized code is executed in a user's browser due to security weaknesses in a web application.

Client-Side Scripting Flaw: A defect in a web application that permits attackers to run harmful scripts on a user's side of the interaction.

Unauthorized Script Running: When a website permits scripts to be inserted and run without proper validation, compromising user security.

Web Page Manipulation Attack: A technique where attackers inject scripts into web pages viewed by others, leading to potential data exposure or manipulation.
