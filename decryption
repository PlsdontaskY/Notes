This error message is related to the Anti-forgery token validation process in ASP.NET, and it occurs when the server is unable to decrypt the anti-forgery token submitted by the client.

There are several reasons why this error could occur, but here are some steps you can take to resolve it:

Check if the machine key configuration is consistent across all servers in the web farm or cluster. The machine key is used to encrypt and decrypt the anti-forgery token, so if it is different across servers, the decryption will fail. You can ensure consistency by setting the same machine key in the web.config file of all servers.

Make sure that the anti-forgery token is being included in all POST requests. This token is typically included in a hidden input field in the form, and it is used to verify that the request came from a trusted source. If the token is missing or invalid, the validation will fail.

Ensure that the application is using the same version of ASP.NET Web Pages across all servers in the web farm or cluster. If there is a version mismatch, the decryption may fail.

Check if the application pool identity has the appropriate permissions to access the temporary folder where the anti-forgery token is stored. By default, this folder is located at %LOCALAPPDATA%\Temp, and the application pool identity needs to have read and write permissions to this folder.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the "anti-forgery token could not be decrypted" error in ASP.NET.



This error message typically indicates that there is an issue with the Anti-Forgery Token used to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks in ASP.NET. Here are a few steps you can take to fix the issue:

Check the version of ASP.NET: Make sure that all the machines in your web farm or cluster are running the same version of ASP.NET. If there is a version mismatch, it can cause the Anti-Forgery Token to fail.

Clear the browser cache: Try clearing the cache in your web browser and reloading the page. Sometimes, cached data can cause issues with Anti-Forgery Tokens.

Verify the token: Double-check that the Anti-Forgery Token is being generated and decrypted correctly. You can do this by inspecting the page source code and looking for the token.

Check the machine key: Ensure that the machine key is the same across all machines in the web farm or cluster. The machine key is used to encrypt and decrypt the Anti-Forgery Token, so if it is different on different machines, it can cause the token to fail.

Use a unique machine key: If you are using a shared hosting environment, try setting a unique machine key for your application. This will ensure that your application's Anti-Forgery Token is not affected by other applications on the same server.

By following these steps, you should be able to fix the "The anti-forgery token could not be decrypted" error in ASP.NET.




This error occurs when the Anti-Forgery Token in the request can not be decrypted. Here are a few steps that you can take to fix this error:

Check the version of ASP.NET Web Pages on all machines in the web farm or cluster. Make sure that all machines are running the same version of ASP.NET Web Pages.

Check if the machineKey element in the web.config file is consistent across all machines. The machineKey element is used for encryption and decryption of the Anti-Forgery Token. You can generate a new machineKey element using the following link: https://www.allkeysgenerator.com/Random/ASP-Net-MachineKey-Generator.aspx

Check if the application pool identity has access to the temporary folder on the server where the application is running. The Anti-Forgery Token uses the temporary folder to store information.

Check if the Anti-Forgery Token is being generated and validated correctly. Make sure that the Anti-Forgery Token is being generated on the server-side using the @Html.AntiForgeryToken() helper method and validated on the server-side using the [ValidateAntiForgeryToken] attribute.

If the above steps do not work, you can try disabling the Anti-Forgery Token feature by removing the @Html.AntiForgeryToken() helper method from your application code.

If none of the above steps work, you may need to provide more information about the specific error message and the configuration of your application to determine the cause of the problem.



This error message usually indicates that there is a problem with the Anti-forgery token validation mechanism in your ASP.NET application. The Anti-forgery token is a security feature that helps prevent cross-site request forgery attacks.

To fix this error, you can try the following steps:

Verify that all the machines in your web farm or cluster are running the same version of ASP.NET Web Pages. If not, update them to the same version.

Check your web.config file and ensure that the "machineKey" element is present and has a valid value. This element is used to encrypt and decrypt the Anti-forgery token. You can generate a new machine key using the IIS Manager or by using a tool like the ASP.NET IIS Registration Tool (aspnet_regiis.exe).

Check that the Anti-forgery token is being created and validated correctly in your code. Make sure that the "AntiForgeryToken" attribute is present on your POST action methods and that the "@Html.AntiForgeryToken()" method is called in your Razor views.

Ensure that any third-party libraries or plugins that you are using in your application are compatible with your version of ASP.NET Web Pages and are not causing conflicts with the Anti-forgery token mechanism.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, you can try enabling debug logging in your application to get more detailed error messages. You can also check the ASP.NET logs for any additional information that may help you identify the root cause of the error.
